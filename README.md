After a few days of playing with it, heres what I can say:
1. I can see it being helpful with fixing a big where we know what the issue is, and if you can phrase the problem and what you expect the correct way for ChatGPT to understand, then it might be able to help you fix it.
2. No matter how many times you tell it to remember something, and even if you have it set in your settings that you like things done this way, it will revert to doing them the way it likes to.
3. It can be fun seeing some things it will create kind of quickly if you ask it the correct way.
